# Python Project: API Integration and Web Scraping

This repository contains a Python project that demonstrates API integration with the iPstack API for retrieving geolocation data, and web scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup for extracting information from eBay.

## Description

The project is divided into two parts:
- **Part 1**: Involves working with the iPstack API to retrieve geolocation data for specified IP addresses and storing the data in a MongoDB database.
- **Part 2**: Uses Selenium and BeautifulSoup to scrape data for "Cell Phones" from eBay, apply certain filters to the search, and save the search results for further parsing and analysis.
