# Event Entry Prediction and Analysis

### Introduction
A project for predicting event entry approvals using various machine learning techniques. The project involves data exploration, visualization, PCA analysis, decision tree analysis, and K-means clustering on a dataset containing event entry information.

### Database
`event_entry`

### Model used
##### PCA Analysis
The PCA analysis is detailed in the notebooks/pca_analysis.ipynb notebook. This notebook covers data splitting, logistic regression model development, PCA application, and performance evaluation.

##### Decision Tree Analysis
The decision tree analysis can be found in the notebooks/decision_tree_analysis.ipynb notebook. This notebook explains the preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

##### K Means Clustering
The K-means clustering process is documented in the notebooks/k_means_clustering.ipynb notebook. It includes feature selection, clustering, optimal K value determination, and visualization of clusters.
