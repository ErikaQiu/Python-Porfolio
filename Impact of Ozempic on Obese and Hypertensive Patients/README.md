## Objective

The primary goal of this assignment is to delve into the effects of Ozempic on obese and
hypertensive patients aged 40-75. A key focus is on addressing endogeneity to estimate the
treatment effect accurately. Through exploratory data analysis, data merging, and the application of
advanced statistical techniques, you will uncover causal relationships and provide insights into the
dataset.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- `ML Ozempic.html`: The main file containing all the code, visualizations, and results.
- `data.zip`: Directory containing the dataset used in the assignment.
- `.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Data Preprocessing & Model Training
The data preprocessing and model training steps are provided in the .ipynb notebook. This notebook includes steps to load the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering.

## Model Development: Double-Lasso / Treatment Effect Lasso:
- Implement the double-lasso technique to estimate the treatment effect of Ozempic,
considering the endogeneity of treatment assignment.
- Justify the inclusion of variables in the model.
