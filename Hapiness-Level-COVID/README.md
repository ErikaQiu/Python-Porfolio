### Global Happiness Level before & after Covid Outbreak
#### Project Abstract
Our primary focus is to assess how the global happiness index has been influenced during the Covid outbreak. Initial investigations leverage dot plots and map plots for a visual comprehension of the changes in happiness scores, followed by a non-parametric test to ascertain significant differences across various regions. Furthermore, we dissect which factors predominantly affect happiness through correlation matrices, multiple linear regression, and increment of R-square analyses.

#### Background
The onset of Covid-19 in January 2020 ushered in unprecedented global changes, from lockdowns to economic turmoil. This project seeks to understand the ramifications of these shifts on global happiness, hypothesizing that the pandemic could have both negative and positive impacts on the well-being of populations worldwide.

#### Data Description
Our analysis employs data from the World Happiness Report, focusing on variables such as GDP per capita, family, health, freedom, generosity, government trust, and dystopia residual across over 100 countries from 2015 to 2022.

#### Key Findings
Global Happiness Shifts: Significant changes in happiness levels were observed post-Covid outbreak, with an unexpected general increase in happiness scores.  
Regional Variations: European countries displayed a positive response in happiness levels, contrary to the decline seen in South American nations.  
Influential Factors on Happiness: Social support emerged as the most influential factor on happiness scores, followed by GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, and freedom.
