    "#### 2. Interact with the Page-Sorting\n",
    "(1)Can you trigger the sorting change directly by modifying only the URL in your browser’s address bar?  If so, how?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes I can trigger the sorting change directly by modifying the keyword behind \"sort\" in the URL. The URL for the website is \"https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/zip?sort=date#search=1~gallery~0~0\" when the sort method is newest. From this original URL, we can see the sorting order is controlled by keyword after the \"?\", which is \"sort\". So, if we want to change the sorting method into oldest by modifying the URL directly, we can change \"sort=date\" into \"sort=dateoldest\". If we want to change the sorting method from oldest back to newest, we can modify the URL from \"sort=dateoldest\" back to \"sort=date\".\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Explain what type of request is made when you change the sort order (GET or POST).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are using GET request when we change the sort order in our URL. GET request is used to retrieve data from a resource and POST request is used to send data to a server in order to update a resource. Hence, when we change the sorting order, the browser sends a GET request to the server with the updated URL. The server then responds with a new page where the listings are sorted by oldest date.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)What is the variable in the URL associated with sorting?\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable in the URL associated with sorting is sort, which is the keyword behine \"?\". By changing the 'sort=date' in the URL, we can change the sorting method."

    "#### 3. Interact with the Page-Pagination\n",
    "\n",
    "(1)Determine how to move between pages by only changing the URL.  What part of the URL changes as you navigate through different pages?\n",
    "\n",
    "When I navigate to different pages, the 'search' part of the URL,the part after the \"#\", will change accrodingly. This is the URL for first page: \"https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/zip?sort=date#search=1~gallery~0~0\". When I navigate to the second page, the part \"#search=1~gallery~0~0\" will become \"#search=1~gallery~1~0\". If we want to go to the third page, it will become \"#search=1~gallery~2~0\". Hence, the key change is in the third segment of this fragment, where it changes as we navigate to different pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Identify the variable associated with page changes.  How does altering this variable in the URL affect the page you’re viewing?\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable associated with page changes is the third segment in 'search', following the pattern #search=1~gallery~X~0, where X represents the page number, starting from zero as the first page and so on. So modifying this variable will change the page you're viewing. For instance, if you change X to 3, the URL should take you to the fourth page of listings. Each increment in the variable X moves you forward one page in the listing."

    "#### 4.Fetch Listing URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Identify the structure that holds the links to individual listing pages.  What selector do you choose to grab the link?\n",
    "\n",
    "The websites contains many posts. All posts are within a 'div' with class 'results cl-results-page'. For each post, it start with a 'li' tag, following by its data-pid, class, and title. Under the 'li' tag, it contains each posts' title, URL, address and so on. All listing posts start with same 'li' tag and class. Hence, in my first method to select all URLs of posts, I used the 'li' tag and the class to select all listing posts and used 'a'tag and 'href' to extract all URLs. \n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Can you identify one more possible selection method to retrieve the link to the individual listing?  Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly with the first method, for the second method to grab the linkes, I looked for common among all listing posts. All URLs of posts are included within 'a' tag and in a same class,'cl-app-anchor.text-only.posting-title'. Hence, I used 'a'tag and the class to select all URLs in the second method.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)Extract the first 250 unique listing URLs and save them to a list.  Consider the pagination feature of Craigslist to navigate through pages.  Explain your strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to grab the 250 listing URLs, I generated a while loop to check it. Using a while loop to keep running until we have 250 links. After extracting all linkes from the page, use if to check if we have enough linkes. If we don't have enough linkes, increment the page number and continue extract linkes from next page until it has 250 URLs."

List of items:  - 4 to-go picnic wine glasses (silicone)  - 5+ plastic plates  - 4 plastic cereal bowls (with straws)  - “life is good” mug  - many new paper plates  - new paper cups  - paper napkins  - assorted Tupperware - old nutribullet with all accessories (works but not in beautiful condition)  - dish rack mat  - glass jars and bottles  - several 8” meat knives  - bread knife  - wooden spoons / stirring utensils  - 2 under-plate trivets  - baking sheet (works but not pretty)  - 8”x8” metal baking pan  - other smaller metal baking pan  - large pot (used for soups / pasta)   Strongly preferred if someone takes all!!! If I don’t get responses tonight, I’ll put the bags out on the sidewalk tomorrow once the ground is dry. If listing is up, the stuff is still available\n",

They were bold and offered to double the difference on advertised prices and I managed to get these for like $100. So, it's not like I have much invested in these guys other than the story.  They are great but I have been moving them around for 3 decades and its TIME TO GO!  If you are the kind of person who can re-foam the cones these will be awesome. Or, maybe you want to cannibalize the parts- great. Or, chop it up for art. I don't care.  Email if interested\n",

      "description:QR Code Link to This Post   I have a disassembled Mydal bunk bed from IKEA. This was in use from 2015-2024 and shows signs of use such as discoloration of some of  the wood. It is made of solid wood, so would be very easy to sand and make as good as new again.   Bunk bed is currently partially disassembled and would be easy to transport in a truck. If you need to transport it in a smaller vehicle such as an SUV, I would be happy to further disassemble it.\n",

It doesn't have a nice finished surface, so it was used with a table cloth. It comes with a 35.5\" lazy Susan made of 3/4\" particle board that spins easily. I couldn't get a photo of the hinged table top as I don't have a place to easily set it up. The photos show both sides of the lazy Susan. It is located in Point Richmond.\n",

However, POST is ususlly used when we need to submit our actions to server while GET is usually used in simple retrieve data. In our situation, since we need to submit our username and password to server, we need to use POST. In addition, if we use GET method, the data will be shown in URL, which means everyone can know my username and password by looking at the my broswer's address bar. My username and password is a privacy data, so we don't want it to be shown in the URL. Using POST method is a good way to solve this problem.
